    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      AntiCopyPaster is
      an <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> plugin
      with the goals of improving the development and refactoring experiences,
      as well as reducing code redundancy. Upon detecting a pasted code
      segment, it scans your active file for duplicates and suggests
      refactoring if appropriate.
